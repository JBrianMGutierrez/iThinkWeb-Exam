Prerequisites:
- composer install
- Create a database named "backend_coding_test"
- php artisan migrate

Populate the product data:
- php artisan tinker
- Product::factory()->count(100)->create()

Say for example, we need a feature where we can display featured products. How would you go about implementing this feature?
- Create a column in Products table "featured" with datatype of tinyint(1) 1 if you want to display as featured then 0 don't display as featured.
- Have front-end that selects items to be featured.
- Then get data where you only want records with columns "featured" is 1.
